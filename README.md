# My Personal Project - *Loan Tracker*

## Description:
- This application is a loan tracker for users to access loan details in different time periods.
- The application can produce loan details of 3 types of loans: 
**Pure discount loans, Interest only loans, Amortized Loans with equal payment**. 
Details of these loans include present value, future value, total payment, interest paid, and principle paid. 
- This application is for borrowers to determine the present value/future value of their loan,
how much money should they be paying every period, and the amount of loan left to be paid.
- This project is of interest for me because I'm in business work with loans a lot.
There are a lot of calculations involved and having an application with the calculations implemented would be useful.
