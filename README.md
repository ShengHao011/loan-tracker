# My Personal Project - *Maze Typing Game*

## Description:
- This application is a game for players to navigate
    an object through a maze by typing in corresponding
    words that will cause the object to **up, right,
    down, up**.
- This application is for individuals who want to 
    play a game while practicing their typing skills.
- This project is of interest to me because I love
    playing video games and want to construct a game
    myself. 




### *User Stories*
- As a user, I want to be able to move the object up
- As a user, I want to be able to move the object right
- As a user, I want to be able to move the object down
- As a user, I want to be able to move the object left
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new map to a list of existing maps
