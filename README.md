# My Personal Project - *Loan Tracker*

## Description:
- This application is a loan tracker for users to create loans and access their details when needed.
- The application can produce loan details of 2 types of loans: 
  **Pure discount loans, Amortized Loans with equal payment**. 
  Details of these loans include present value, future value, total payment, interest paid, and principle paid. 
- This application is for users to access details of their loan. They can then 
  make decisions like how much money should they be paying every period, and the amount of loan left to be paid.
- This project is of interest for me because I'm in business and work with loans a lot.
  There are a lot of calculations involved and having an application with the calculations implemented would be useful.
  It also allows me to add extra components in the future as I learn more about the in depth details of loans.
